# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## About myself
Currently I attend the University of Debrecen and I'm studying Computer Science. I prefer to create websites and manage databases.
I'm proficient in some programming languages, for instance: SQL, JavaScript and PHP
(because HTML and CSS are not considered programming languages). <br />
